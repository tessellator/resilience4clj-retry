## Quick Start

The following code defines a function `make-remote-call` that will retry in case
of a failure using a retry named `:some-name` and stored in the default registry.
If the retry does not already exist, one is created.

```clojure
(ns myproject.some-client
  (:require [clj-http.client :as http]
            [resilience4clj.retry :refer [with-retry]])

(defn make-remote-call []
  (with-retry :some-name
    (http/get "https://www.example.com")))
```

Refer to the [configuration guide](/doc/01_configuration.md) for more
information on how to configure the global registry as well as individual
retrys.

Refer to the [usage guide](/doc/02_usage.md) for more information on how to
use retrys.
